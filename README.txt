
*****Multi-Vehicle Patrolling for Assessing Port Disruptions v1.0*****

This project was built entirely in python. In order for the program to work you need only to install
python 3.6 or higher and the matplotlib and networkx correctly. Once you have done 
so, make sure that the following files are all in the same directory:

NetXroutes.py
PathPlanning.py
MapProperties.py
MapFunctions.py
Port.png 

Now simply run NetXroutes.py using the appropriate python commands for your machine and dont forget to add 
-a, -g or -s to select a map type. More information on installation and commands can be found in the 
user manual included in the code directory.
